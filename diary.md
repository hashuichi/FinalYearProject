# Term 1

## Week 1 (September 25th)
- Found research papers related to the topic
- Completed project plan initial draft
- Startd researching about the implementation of the machine learning algorithms

## Week 2 (October 2nd)
- Completed final draft for the project plan
- Researched technologies to use for the project

## Week 3 (October 9th)
- Researched data fields needed for a hotel pricing dataset
- Generated fake dataset

## Week 4 (October 16th)
- Created implementation for nearest neighbours
- Used hyperparameter tuning to find best K
- Found MSE
- Predicted price of new data
- Reported the results

## Week 5 (October 23rd)
- Refactored code by creating 3 separate files:
    - main.py
    - nearest_neighbours.py
    - gui.py
- Created GUI with Streamlit to:
    - Predict hotel price from user input
    - Represent MSE of Nearest Neighbours algorithm with different k values on a graph
    - Display best k and mse values for the training set

## Week 6 (October 30th)
- Generated structured data based on star rating and distances (Replaces old data generated with Faker)
- Generated graphs to check structure of data with matplotlib
- Scaled data to fit the correct range

## Week 7 (November 6th)
- Rewrote Nearest Neighbours to fit new data
- Wrote unit tests for testing nearest neighbours
- Started working on interim report
- Added a navbar and created pages to prepare for the development of the other algorithms

## Week 8 (November 13th)
